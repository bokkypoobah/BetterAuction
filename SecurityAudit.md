# Security Audit Of The BetterAuction Smart Contract

The BetterAuction smart contract allows the owner (beneficiary) to conduct an auction of a digital (or not) asset on the Ethereum blockchain. Bidders can send ethers to the smart contract and the highest bid is locked in the smart contract. Non-highest bids can deposit further ethers or withdraw their deposit ethers by sending a withdrawal trigger amount. At the end of the auction period, the beneficiary closes the auction to receive the highest bidder's ethers. The other non-highest bidders can still withdraw their bid amounts. After a period, the beneficiary can recover all funds and send the appropriate amounts to the non-highest bidders if these individuals have not claimed their non-highest bids.

## Background And History
* Mar 20 2017 Amir requested for an audit of an auction contract 
* The versions of iterative code changes follow:
  * Mar 21 2017 [Steve's initial SimpleAuction](https://gist.github.com/slavik0329/857458d42d3c57d7ef2c1e686c2c650d)
  * Mar 21 2017 [Lots of changes from Bok Consulting's recommendation, removing magic numbers, modifiers for conditions, code and comment formatting](https://gist.github.com/slavik0329/c61aed6596bde40a3c382bb3a3dff0d1)
  * Mar 22 2017 [SimpleAuction renamed to BetterAuction, functions renamed, bid update logic](https://gist.github.com/slavik0329/58f1944d61d00575476ee47937c3486c)
  * Mar 22 2017 [Adding missing event log](https://gist.github.com/slavik0329/c8523d41e05ff69907e42811be8cb1a2)
  * Mar 29 2017 [Check of 0x0 beneficiary in constructor, throw for bids with 0 values](https://gist.github.com/slavik0329/a46faaddd029e4adf5f8b29d969a9bbf)
  * Apr 03 2017 [Removing unnecessary +=, tidy](https://gist.github.com/slavik0329/e91516a12d9229fc0828dbda6a76a08e)
  * Apr 03 2017 [Update 0.4.0 to 0.4.8, removing unnecessary +=](https://gist.github.com/slavik0329/66c34a07ea9ed075d99cb2f8648a4ddf)
  * Apr 05 2017 [Addition of header comment](https://github.com/slavik0329/BetterAuction/blob/1c0161fbb288dcdb19906c85538e2a6d5861f82b/betterauction.sol)
* Apr 11 2017 Bok Consulting completed the test script [test/01_test1.sh](test/01_test1.sh) with the generated result documented in [test/test1results.txt](test/test1results.txt)
* Apr 16 2017 Bok Consulting completed this security audit report

## Security Overview Of The BetterAuction Contract
* [x] The smart contract has been kept relatively simple
* [x] The code has been tested for the normal use cases, and around the boundary cases
* [x] The testing has been done using geth 1.5.9-stable and solc 0.4.9+commit.364da425.Darwin.appleclang instead of one of the testing frameworks and JavaScript VMs to simulate the live environment as closely as possible
* [x] Only the `send(...)` call has been used instead of `call.value()()` for transferring funds with limited gas to minimise reentrancy attacks
* [x] The `send(...)` calls are the last statements in the control flow to prevent the hijacking of the control flow
* [x] The return status from `send(...)` calls are all checked and invalid results will **throw** 
* [x] Funds are transferred from this auction contract by account holders "pulling" their funds
  * [x] Only the beneficiary can call `beneficiaryRecoverFunds(...)` to receive the beneficiary's funds
  * [x] Only the beneficiary can call `beneficiaryCloseAuction(...)` to receive the winning bidder's funds
  * [x] Non-highest bidders retrieve their funds by calling `nonHighestBidderRefund(...)`
* [x] There is no logic with potential division by zero errors
* [x] All numbers used are uint256, reducing the risk of errors from type conversions
* [x] There is no logic with potential overflow errors, as the numbers added are taken from the value of ethers sent in each transaction, this value is validated as part of the sent transactions and these values are small compared to the uint256 limits
* [x] There is no logic with potential underflow errors as there are no subtractions used in this code
* [x] Function and event names are differentiated by case - function names begin with a lowercase character and event names begin with an uppercase character

### Other Notes
* While the BetterAuction Solidity code logic has been audited, there are small possibilities of errors that could compromise the security of this contract. This includes errors in the Solidity to bytecode compilation, errors in the execution of the VM code, or security failures in the Ethereum blockchain
  * For example see [Security Alert – Solidity – Variables can be overwritten in storage](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/01/security-alert-solidity-variables-can-overwritten-storage/)
* There is the possibility of a miner mining a block and skewing the `now` timestamp. This can result valid bids being rejected and invalid bids being accepted, and this would be most relevant at the end of the auction period
* If possible, run a [bug bounty program](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#bug-bounty-programs) on this contract code
* Some of the recommended code changes, the testing and the security audit were conducted by Bok Consulting, and this is a potential conflict of interest

## Comments On The Source Code

My comments in the following code are marked in the lines beginning with `// NOTE: `

// BetterAuction
//
// Decentralised open auction on the Ethereum blockchain
//
// Note: When a bidder is outbid they can top up their bid by sending more
// ether to the contract or they can get their outbid funds back by calling 
// nonHighestBidderRefund directly or by simply sending exactly 0.0001 ETH
